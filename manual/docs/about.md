###Bug reports
Please send any bug reports using [GitHub](https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/LogMl/issues)

**IMPORTANT:** In order to reproduce the error condition, you MUST send a minimal example.
The example should be: minimal, self contained, and only involve LogMl

This means:

-  **Minimal:** There should be only a few lines of code, a small dataset and configuration YAML specifically showing the problem (please do not send hundreds of lines of code, Gigabytes of data or your complete ML analysis).
- **Self contained:** No additional data should be required to run your example (e.g. I should not need you to send me additional 10TB data files to run the script).
- **Only LogMl**: No additional packages should be required to run your example (e.g. I should not need to install programs/packages on my computer to run your example).
